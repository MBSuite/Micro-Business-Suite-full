# RBAC Standard (Canonical)

This document defines the single access-control standard for Micro Business Suite.

## Canonical Roles

- `superadmin`: full administrative control
- `admin`: administrative control for operations and configuration
- `user`: standard user access, constrained by assigned RBAC groups

Rules:
- Store roles in lowercase only.
- Do not introduce legacy role aliases from older revisions.
- Role labels in UI may be localized, but stored values must remain canonical.

## Canonical Permission Model

Permission source of truth is group-based RBAC:
- `groups`
- `group_permissions`
- `user_groups`

Actions:
- `create`
- `read`
- `update`
- `delete`
- `export`
- `manage`

## Authorization Policy

- Access checks must be permission-driven where module-level control exists.
- For administrative boundaries, use canonical helpers:
  - `normalizeRole()`
  - `canAccessAdmin()`

## Non-Destructive Change Policy

- Never reset, drop, or recreate production tables to "fix" schema mismatch.
- Use additive, backward-compatible migrations only.
- Preserve existing data and historical accounting evidence.

## Implementation Notes

- Standard helper file: `lib/core-standards.ts`
- Master guardrail file: `CORE_RULES.md`
